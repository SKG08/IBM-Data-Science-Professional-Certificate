The commercial space age is here, companies are making space travel affordable for everyone. The major service providers and manufacturers are Virgin Galactic , Rocket Lab and Blue Origin. Perhaps the most successful is SpaceX. SpaceX’s accomplishments include: Sending spacecraft to the International Space Station. Starlink, a satellite internet constellation providing satellite Internet access. 
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upwards of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. First  stage is quite large and expensive and most of the work is done by the this stage. Unlike other rocket providers, SpaceX's Falcon 9 Can recover the first stage.
In this capstone project, the job is to determine the price of each launch for SpaceX’s competitor Space Y as well as, predicting if SpaceX will reuse the first stage by developing machine learning model trained on data available in public domain.
